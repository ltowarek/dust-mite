# dust-mite

dust-mite is a playground for building a self-driving RC car across different hardware and software setups.

The goal is not to create the most advanced self-driving RC car. The goal is to experiment, compare platforms, and learn something new with every iteration.

## Why this project

- Explore multiple HW + SW combinations for the same core objective.
- Learn by building real systems end to end.
- Keep the project practical, hackable, and easy to evolve.

## Quick start

Getting started instructions are in [docs/quick_start.md](docs/quick_start.md).

## Variants

There are multiple dust-mite variants documented in [docs/variants.md](docs/variants.md).

## Development environment
